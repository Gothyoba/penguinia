Morguin is taken from behind by a priest.

Morguin: What? Who are you? What are you doing? (panicking)

Priest Kalara: You have commited too many crimes you are coming here.

Morguin: What? What did I do? Let go!

Priest Kalara: You are coming behind the temple, Morguin.

Morguin: Who even are you? Let go!

Priest Kalara: You know my name.

Morguin: No! No! Stop! Are you-

Priest Kalara: I am Kalara.

Morguin is pulled by the neck, slowly suffocating behind the great temple.

Morguin: I - am - getting - out!

Priest Kalara: You do not vandalize the temple, former underpriest.

Morguin: The gods still empower me!

Priest Kalara: Your power is over.

Kalara throws Morguin to the wall.

Morguin: Get out! Get out!

Priest Kolichi: I will be the one to administer the dose.

Morguin: Of what?

A seal is thrown by one of the priests.

Priest Kolichi: Oh. ANother one of those seals.

Seal: I was ordered. I was ordered! No!

Morguin attempts to strnagle Kolichi, yet he is thrown to the ground.

The seal attempts to escape.

Morguin: What did I do?

Priest Kolichi: You know what you did.

The seal beats Kolichi.

Kolichi: Stop!
