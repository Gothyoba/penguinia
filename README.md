Penguinia

Penguinia will be a text-based exploration and combat game made in python. Penguinia is currently in very early development, so expect limited playability and feature, as well as many bugs.

Currently Penguinia does not yet have a full prototype, but it is playable. In order to play penguinia, run the file run.py in a console or terminal. There is currently no tutorial.

How to play:

Type everything in lowercase without any errors if you want the game to understand you. Always press enter after each command you give to the game. Her are all working commands:

w - moves the player north

a - moves the player west

s - moves the player south

d - moves the player east

e - ends the game

Each time you move the player the game will output two numbers representing the coordinates of the player. In the future this will be replaced by a description of where you are.

Note: This game only works with python version 3.10 and above as well as the corresponding version of numpy.

Have fun playing Penguinia!
