# Penguinia

Penguinia is a free and open source text-based exploration and combat game made in python. Penguinia is currently in very early development, so expect limited playability and features, as well as many bugs.

Penguinia is currently in alpha, specifically on version 0.1.3. Development for 0.2 is happening on branch main, and 0.3 is planned. In order to play penguinia, run the file run.py in a console capable of running python.

In Penguinia, one must type and enter commands to get a short description of the world around you and how you have changed it. Instead of looking at what you do, Penguinia makes you read what you do.

Penguinia lets you explore a 3 by 7 grid with 21 interesting fantasy locations and an 8-part main quest. Version 0.2 will introduce long, complex and fun dialogues. In version 0.3 you will be able to switch weapons.

Note: This game requires python version 3.10 and above as well as the corresponding version of the library numpy.

Have fun playing Penguinia!
