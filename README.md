# Penguinia

Penguinia is a text-based exploration and combat game made in python. Penguinia is currently in very early development, so expect limited playability and features, as well as many bugs.

Currently Penguinia is on version 0.0.2. In order to play penguinia, run the file run.py in a console capable of running python. There is currently no in-game tutorial.

## How to play:

Type everything in lowercase without any errors if you want the game to understand you. Always press enter after each command you give to the game. Here are all working commands:

w - moves the player north

a - moves the player west

s - moves the player south

d - moves the player east

q - checks for quests(there is currently a bug that does not let you check for quests outside of the starting area)

e - ends the game

y - starts a quest after the command q has been given

n - opposite of yes

o - attacks enemy while in combat

p - sets your hitpoints to just under your maximum hitpoints in combat if you have a potion

Each time you move the player the game will output the name of where you are, or a placeholder name. In the future this will be a more detailed description for each location.

Penguinia currently limits the player to a 3 by 3 grid, however this grid will expand in the next few updates.

Note: This game only works with python version 3.10 and above as well as the corresponding version of numpy.

Have fun playing Penguinia!
