# Penguinia

Penguinia is a free and open source text-based exploration and combat game made in python. In it you follow the story of a Penguin named Morguin in an unusual format. Penguinia is currently in very early development, so expect limited playability and features, as well as many bugs. The game is designed to mainly be an interactive storyline.

In Penguinia, one must type and enter commands to get a short description of the world around you and how you have changed it and what happens next in the story. Instead of looking at what you do, Penguinia makes you read what you do. Through various quests, you can follow a storyline sending you throughout the world.

Penguinia is currently in alpha, specifically on version 0.2,1. Becuase of this, many features such as a proper inventory for combat are missing. However,  any of these features are coming in the next few updates. Development for version 0.3 is happening on  branch main, and 0.4 is planned. In order to play penguinia, download the game from here, unzip it and run the file run.py in a console/application capable of running python. Version info with more detailed requirements can be found below.

Despite being in such an early stage of development, Penguinia still lets you explore a 3 by 7 grid with 21 interesting fantasy locations and an 8-part main quest. It even has its own optional fictional language to learn!

Note: This game requires python version 3.10 and above as well as numpy version 1.22.0 and above
