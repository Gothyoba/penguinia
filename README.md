# Penguinia

Penguinia is a free and open source text-based exploration and combat game made in python. Penguinia is currently in very early development, so expect limited playability and features, as well as many bugs.

Penguinia is currently on version 0.0.4. In order to play penguinia, run the file run.py in a console capable of running python. There is currently no in-game tutorial.

Each time you move the player the game will output the name of where you are, or a placeholder name. In the future this will be a more detailed description for each location.

Penguinia currently limits the player to a 3 by 3 grid, however this grid will expand in the next few updates.

Note: This game requires python version 3.10 and above as well as the corresponding version of numpy.

Have fun playing Penguinia!
