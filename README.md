# Penguinia

Penguinia is a free and open source text-based exploration and combat game made in python. In it you follow the story of a Penguin named Morguin in an unusual format. Penguinia is currently in very early development, so expect limited playability and features, as well as many bugs.

In Penguinia, one must type and enter commands to get a short description of the world around you and how you have changed it. Instead of looking at what you do, Penguinia makes you read what you do.

Penguinia is currently in alpha, specifically on version 0.2. Development for version 0.2.1 is happening on the branch main, and version 0.3 is planned. In order to play penguinia, run the file run.py in a console capable of running python.

Penguinia lets you explore a 3 by 7 grid with 21 interesting fantasy locations and an 8-part main quest. Version 0.2 will introduce long, complex and fun dialogues. In version 0.3 you will be able to switch weapons.

Note: This game requires python version 3.10 and above as well as the corresponding version of the library numpy.

Have fun playing Penguinia!
