# Penguinia

Penguinia is a free and open source text-based exploration and combat game made in python. Penguinia is currently in very early development, so expect limited playability and features, as well as many bugs.

Penguinia is currently in alpha, specifically on version 0.1.1. In order to play penguinia, run the file run.py in a console capable of running python.

Each time you move the player the game will output the name of where you are, or a placeholder name. In the future this will be a more detailed description for each location.

Penguinia lets you explore a 3 by 7 grid with 21 interesting fantasy locations and an 8-part main quest.

Note: This game requires python version 3.10 and above as well as the corresponding version of numpy.

Have fun playing Penguinia!
